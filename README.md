# Matrices
A python class which creates matricies using 2D arrays

The file also contains some built in matrices, such as 2-dimensional transformations that represents reflections in the x and y axes. There is also the "Rotation2D" function which creates a matrix representing a 2-dimensional rotation anti-clockwise of a specified angle about the origin.
